India is a hot country with very high temperatures during April, May, and June. A short trip to a hill station every summer is exciting and quite tempting. Everybody wants to escape the blazing heat to refresh and rejuvenate. People who cannot afford to travel abroad are always keen to visit nearby hill stations to enjoy the summers. It is a great escapade for people, away from the high temperatures of the plains.
